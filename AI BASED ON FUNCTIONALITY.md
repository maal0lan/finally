1. REACTIVE MACHINES
What it is: AI in its most basic form. Only current inputs can cause these systems to react. They are incapable of learning, remembering, or comprehending the past.

Behavior: They simply follow preprogrammed rules without getting better over time. No forecast for the future either.

Real-world Vibe: Similar to a vending machine that only gives you what you ask for, regardless of your identity or previous selection.

example:

In 1997, IBM Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion. It didn't recall previous games, but it computed every move that could be made at that precise moment.
2. LIMITED MEMORY
What it is: These AIs have the ability to learn from past data and use current information to make better decisions. However, their memory is not permanent.

Behavior: They make use of deep learning and other machine learning models. Based on past experiences, they learn, adapt, and react.

Real-world Vibe: Similar to a driver who, after parking, forgets everything but remembers the last few turns.

Example:

autonomous vehicles that can learn from user behavior, traffic, and weather conditions.

This also applies to ChatGPT and Alexa, which "remember" the context of the conversation (limited window).

3. THEORY OF MIND (Not yet achieved)
What it is: A cutting-edge form of artificial intelligence that can comprehend human intentions, feelings, convictions, and social cues.

Behavior: This AI would have emotional intelligence, empathy, and the ability to predict behavior in addition to simply responding.

Real-world Vibe: Like when someone realizes you're angry and modifies their tone instead of just responding rationally.

Example:

We haven't arrived yet. However, research is being done on human-interaction bots and AIs that can detect emotions.

4. SELF-AWARE (Fully fictional so far)
What it is: The ultimate AI. It would have consciousness, self-awareness, and a sense of its own existence and purpose.

Behavior: It can reflect, feel, plan its own goals â€” not just perform tasks.

Real-world Vibe: Like Ultron, Jarvis, or HER â€” it knows itâ€™s an entity and can act based on self-interest.

Example:

Pure sci-fi for now. We havenâ€™t built anything close to this (and maybe shouldnâ€™t yet ðŸ‘€).
