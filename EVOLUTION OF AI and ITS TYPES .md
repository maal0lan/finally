# Timeline of AI EVOLUTION

## 1940s
- **1943:** First concept of artificial neuron (McCulloch & Pitts)

## 1950s - (CONCEPTUAL)
- **1950:** Turing Test proposed by Alan Turing
- **1956:** Dartmouth Workshop: Birth of AI

## 1960s - (REACTIVE)
- **1966:** ELIZA chatbot created by Joseph Weizenbaum

## 1980s - (LIMITED MEMORY)
- Somewhere in 1980s "RISE OF MACHINE LEARNING" for spam filtering like calls and mms

## 1990s - (REACTIVE)
- **1997**  "IBM Deep Blue beats Kasparov" - First AI to beat a world chess champion using brute-force rules
  
## 2000s - (LIMITED MEMORY)
- **2006** "Deep learing era /Big Data" -Neural networks explode with GPU use & big data ,image classifications
  
## 2010 - (LIMITED MEMORY)
- **2011** "IBM Watson wins Jeopardy" - Data-driven QA system with some learning and natural language processing
- **2015**  "Tesla autopilot, AI in healthcare" - Self-driving cars & predictive AI systems boom , IBM Medical AI.
  
## 2020s - (LIMITED MEMORY/THEORY OF MIND)
- **2020** "GPT-3 released" - Deep learning-based language model trained on massive internet data
- **2023** "GPT-4 + Theory of Mind discussion" - Debates begin about AI understanding intention & emotion (emotion tagging starts)
  
## 2030+ maybe ..
- Self-aware AI era (hypothetical) - AI that reflects on its existence, has a sense of self - JARVIS from IRON MAN or ULTRON (*as reference)





# AI BASED ON THEIR FUNCTIONALITY

## REACTIVE MACHINES 
### What it is: 
- AI in its most basic form. Only current inputs can cause these systems to react. They are incapable of learning, remembering, or comprehending the past.
### Behavior: 
- They simply follow preprogrammed rules without getting better over time. No forecast for the future either.
### Real-world exmaple: 
- Similar to a vending machine that only gives you what you ask for, regardless of your identity or previous selection.
- In 1997, IBM Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion. It didn't recall previous games, but it computed every move that could be made at that precise moment.

## 2. LIMITED MEMORY 
### What it is: 
- These AIs have the ability to learn from past data and use current information to make better decisions. However, their memory is not permanent.
### Behavior: 
- They make use of deep learning and other machine learning models. Based on past experiences, they learn, adapt, and react.
### Real-world Vibe: 
- Similar to a driver who, after parking, forgets everything but remembers the last few turns.
- Autonomous vehicles that can learn from user behavior, traffic, and weather conditions.
- This also applies to ChatGPT and Alexa, which "remember" the context of the conversation (limited window).

## 3. THEORY OF MIND (Not yet achieved) 
### What it is: 
- A cutting-edge form of artificial intelligence that can comprehend human intentions, feelings, convictions, and social cues.
### Behavior: This AI would have emotional intelligence, empathy, and the ability to predict behavior in addition to simply responding.
### Real-world Vibe: 
- Like when someone realizes you're angry and modifies their tone instead of just responding rationally.
- We haven't arrived yet. However, research is being done on human-interaction bots and AIs that can detect emotions.

## 4. SELF-AWARE (Fully fictional so far) 
### What it is: 
- The ultimate AI. It would have consciousness, self-awareness, and a sense of its own existence and purpose.
### Behavior: 
- It can reflect, feel, plan its own goals â€” not just perform tasks.

### Real-world Vibe: 
- Like Ultron, Jarvis, or HER â€” it knows itâ€™s an entity and can act based on self-interest.
- Pure sci-fi for now. We havenâ€™t built anything close to this (and maybe shouldnâ€™t yet ðŸ‘€).
